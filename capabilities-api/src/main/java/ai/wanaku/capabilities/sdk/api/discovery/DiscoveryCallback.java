/**
 * Callback interface for receiving notifications about service registration lifecycle events.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface can be registered with a {@link RegistrationManager}
 * to receive notifications when registration-related operations occur, such as successful
 * registration, deregistration attempts, or periodic health check pings.</p>
 *
 * <p>Callbacks are invoked synchronously after the corresponding operation completes.
 * If a callback throws an exception, it will be logged but will not prevent other
 * registered callbacks from executing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * RegistrationManager manager = ...;
 * manager.addCallBack(new RegistrationCallback() {
 *     @Override
 *     public void onRegistration(RegistrationManager manager) {
 *         // Handle successful registration
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onPing(RegistrationManager manager, int status) {
 *         // Handle ping result
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void onDeregistration(RegistrationManager manager, int status) {
 *         // Handle deregistration result
 *     }
 * });
 * }</pre>
